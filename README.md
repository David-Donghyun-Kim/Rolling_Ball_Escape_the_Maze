# Rolling Ball Escape the Maze
This is a personal project that I did with 2 people, Minwoo Ju, and Kunhee Lee.

We finished and built this project at August 15, 2019

This project is a game to escape the maze by manipulating the ball, which is a player.

This is single player, top-view game, consist with multiple levels.

Prim's algorithm is used to generate random maze, and A* algorithm is used for enemy AI's pathfinding.
